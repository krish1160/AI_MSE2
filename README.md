# Air Quality Level Classification

## Problem Statement
Predict the air quality category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) using various environmental indicators.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- PM2.5
- NO2
- Temperature
- AirQualityLevel (target label)

## Results
- The model classified air quality levels with fair accuracy.
- PM2.5 and NO2 were the most important features.
- Confusion matrix helped identify common prediction errors.
